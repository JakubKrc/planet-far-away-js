# Planet Far Away

A small playable 2D platformer you can actually finish, featuring a strange code-generating level editor and a handful of short episode levels.

---

## Features

- Basic tile-based 2D engine  
- Two sample mini-episodes  
- Built-in level editor (glitchy, generates level data as code that must be pasted manually — realistically only I can use it)  
- Checkpoint system  
- Enemies interact with collision boxes:
  - Change movement direction  
  - Trigger jumps  

---

## Technology

- Written **from scratch in JavaScript**  
- Dockerized for simple deployment (Nginx + GitHub Actions)  

---

## Known Issues

- Objects move left faster than they should when using decimal speed values  
- Player can get stuck on tile. But can get unstuck.

---

## Roadmap

No active plans for further development.  
This project remains as a completed experiment.

---

## Running Locally

You can run the project using a Live Server extension or any static file server.  
There is **no need to run Docker** for local development.
